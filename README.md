# MachineLearning_CourseProject

Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit*, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify *how much* of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*. In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of six participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in five different ways. More information is available from the website [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the **Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset**).

After narrowing the training set down to 32 predictors, a model was fit using the random forest methodâ€”resulting in an expected accuracy of 99.8 percent.
